# Set List Lab - Redux Delete

## Objectives

1. Implement a delete button for each band, such that the store is appropriately updated.

## Overview

Well all things change, and sometimes that means that even our favorite bands breakup and
we must remove all evidence of them. We want an application that allows us to remove
specific bands, and have those changes reflected in our store's state, and on the page.  

We are starting off with our work from the previous lab, a React/Redux app that creates new
band elements and displays them below. Your task will be to add the deleting a band functionality.

## Instructions

The BandInput component is already set up for you and BandsContainer is
partially working, but take a moment to note the flow of information. The
BandsContainer is connected to __Redux__ and has mapped `name => dispatch({ type:
"ADD_BAND", name })` to props.

1. Set up the new `Band` component that is in charge of displaying the information
for a single band.

2. Create a new `Bands` component. This component will handle the rendering of all `Band` 
components from a list of bands provided as props.

3. Use `BandsContainer` to access the Redux store that contains any band information using
the provided `mapStateToProps` method. Pass these bands into the `Bands` component.

4. In the `manageBand` reducer, change the structure of the state such that each band is assigned its own ID. You
will also need to pass this info through to the band object (this should include the _id_ and
_name_ of the band) as the props to each rendered `Band` component.

5. In the `Band` component, you will need to add a button that dispatches an
action of type `'DELETE_BAND'` and then passes through that band's id as the
`action.id`. This dispatched action should be provided as a prop from
BandsContainer.

6. You will have to alter the reducer such that it creates a new list of bands
that does not include the one whose delete button was pressed.
